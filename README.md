# Hands - On Reinforcement Learning with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands - On Reinforcement Learning with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-reinforcement-learning-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392402), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The scope of Reinforcement Learning applications outside toy examples is immense. Reinforcement Learning can optimize agricultural yield in IoT powered greenhouses, and reduce power consumption in data centers. It's grown in demand to the point where its applications range from controlling robots to extracting insights from images and natural language data. By the end of this course, you will not only be able to solve these problems but will also be able to use Reinforcement Learning as a problem-solving strategy and use different algorithms to solve these problems.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is intended for people who have some understanding of supervised learning, and are interested in artificial intelligence. After completing the course, you can delve into specific RL topics, and start solving more complex RL problems on OpenAI Gym or similar. No prior Reinforcement Learning knowledge is required, although knowing Python and having a quantitative background will help you follow the video more effectively.	
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
This will vary on a product-by-product basis, but should be a standard PI element for ILT products. This example is relatively basic.
